# post_write_hooks defines scripts or Python functions that are run

# detail and examples

# Example post-write hook using "black" - use the console_scripts runner, against the "black" entrypoint
# hooks = black
# black.type = console_scripts
# black.entrypoint = black
# black.options = -l 79 REVISION_SCRIPT_FILENAME

# Example post-write hook for linting and fixing using "ruff" - use the exec runner, execute a binary
# hooks = ruff
# ruff.type = exec
# ruff.executable = %(here)s/.venv/bin/ruff
# ruff.options = --fix REVISION_SCRIPT_FILENAME
